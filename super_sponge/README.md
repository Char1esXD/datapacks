# Super Sponge

[latest version (v1.0)](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/super_sponge/SuperSponge_v1.0.zip) (1.14)

## What it does

This datapack allows for the creation of super sponges that effectively remove all water in a large area.

Craftable by default by throwing 6 regular sponges and 3 nether stars onto the ground together. Can easily be adjusted to whatever fits your servers needs. (If you need help with that, [feel free to reach out](http://plagiatus.net/#contact)).

## How to set up

Download the zip file and place it into your `world/datapacks` folder. If the world is already running, run `reload`. That's all you need to do.  
That way it has been set to **10 blocks range**. To change that, use the following command in chat (replace XX with your desired range):

    scoreboard players set maximum fillsponge XX

This number can be changed at any time you want.

**Be aware that using this sponge especially with higher maximum numbers will lag the server!**
