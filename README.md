# Datapacks

This is where you can find all of my datapacks for 1.13 (and above hopefully).

## Utility

### [Multiplayer Percentage Sleeping System](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/tree/master/multiplayer_sleep)  
Set a percentage of players required to sleep. That way not everyone on the server has to be in a bed to pass the night.

## Games

### [Itemchallenge](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/tree/master/itemchallenge)  
Collect every item in the game and bring it to a shrine. As seen in Hardcore Hermits S5.
