# Mobchallenge
### kill every mob in the game

[latest version (v1.0)](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/mobchallenge/mobchallenge_perworld_v1.0.zip) (1.13.1)
[minecraft 1.14 version, tested in 18w14a (v2.0)](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/mobchallenge/mobchallenge_perworld_v2.0.0.zip) (1.14)


## How to play

Find and kill every mob in the game. It's as easy as that.  
There are 52 (+4) mobs in this game that can be killed. This pack tracks 55 of them.
(The +4 are giant, illusioner, zombie horse, and other players, which aren't neccessarily available in the game. The later 3 are part of the pack.)
_(In 1.14 there are a total of 62 mobs, the only one not tracked is the giant.)_


## How to set up

Download the zip file and place it into your `world/datapacks` folder. If the world is already running, run `reload`. That's all you need to do.

### Multiplayer

It is possible to play this datapack in multiplayer, but the scores are counted for the whole world and not individually per player.

A second pack that tracks per player is in the works.

### Problems that may occur

When in multiplayer you kill a mob while another player is offline, they won't recieve the updated advancements when they come back online until someone kills something they haven't killed yet.
